# Matrix-headerFile
###### This file contains class matrix..
###### One can include this file in program as ```#include "matrix.h"```
###### Using this file one can create an object of class Matrix...
 
#### Methods :
######  Matrix A;               // Created an object A of class Matrix.
###### 1. A.setMatrix() : This will prompt user for the size of matrix as number of rows and colomn.
######                  And according to that user would have to give input.
###### 2. A.display()   : This method will display the matrix.
###### 3. A.makeREF()   : This method whould convert the matrix to corrosponding REF matrix.
###### 4. A.makeRREF()  : This method whould convert the matrix to corrosponding RREF matrix.

#### Matrix Operations :
###### Matrix A, B;             // Created two objects A and B of class Matrix.
###### A.setMatrix();           // Setting values of A.
###### B.setMatrix();           // Setting values of B.
###### Matrix C = A + B;     // Value of C will become equal to sum of A and B.
###### Matrix C = A - B;     // Value of C will become equal to difference of A and B.
###### Matrix C = A * B;     // Value of C will become equal to matrix multiplaction of A and B.
